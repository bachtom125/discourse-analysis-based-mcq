              "4247  So my knowledge of the inner workings of that group is somewhat limited. But what reminded me of the coven was that Chewie's family seems to have a lot of ritual aspects to it, that sort of strengthen it as a community, which I really liked about it. If there's anything you can get out of relationships with lots of people it's a sense of community. Granted, the coven group was all ritual all the time and they were much less casual than what I saw last night, but I think that was part of what made them kind of unappealing. I ' ve always wanted to find something that made me feel spiritually fulfilled, and rituals are a great way to achieve that feeling, however the coven often came across as exclusive and occasionally insane.   \n",
